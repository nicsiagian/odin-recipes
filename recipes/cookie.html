  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p1>The method here is so simple, that you can absolutely make it in your pajamas with the light of Netflix playing in the background, like I have many, many times. There is no need to use a special hand mixer or even a special bowl. I make mine in a cereal bowl, because it makes such a small amount of batter. Also, I think it goes without saying, but you don't need to chill this dough. Just mix, shape, press on extra chocolate, and bake!</p1>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 Tablespoons of Melted Butter</li>
    <li> 3 Tablespoons of Brown Sugar</li>
    <li>One Egg Yolk</li>
    <li>1/4 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
    <li>1/4 Cup Flour</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons of Chocolate Chips</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350-degrees Fahrenheit, and line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the melted butter and brown sugar in a small bowl, and stir to dissolve.</li>
    <li>Next, add the egg yolk and vanilla, and stir again to combine very well.</li>
    <li>Evenly sprinkle the flour and salt over the bowl, and stir together well. Do not over-mix or stir too long, but just stir until no streaks of flour remain.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle in the chocolate chips into the dough, and stir just to combine the dough for one chocolate chip cookie.</li>
    <li>Place all of the dough in a rough circular shape on the prepared baking pan. Just before baking, press a few additional chocolate chips on top.</li>
    <li>Bake for 14-16 minutes, until the edges are starting to turn golden brown and the center is set. Let the cookie cool on the sheet pan before removing so that it sets and doesn't break apart too easily. She's a big cookie, and she's fragile while hot.</li>
  </ol>
