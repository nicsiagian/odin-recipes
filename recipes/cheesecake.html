    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the crust: Combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, 
            and cinnamon in a bowl; mix well. Press onto the bottom of an ungreased 9-inch springform pan. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Place strawberries and cornstarch into a blender; cover and puree until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour strawberry sauce into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. 
            Boil and stir until sauce is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Set aside 1/3 cup strawberry sauce; cool. 
            Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce for serving.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; gradually beat in condensed milk. 
            Mix in lemon juice and vanilla extract, 
            then beat in eggs on low speed until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture over crust; drop 1/2 of the reserved strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on cream cheese layer. 
            Carefully spoon remaining cream cheese mixture over sauce; drop remaining strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on top. Cut through the top layer only with a knife to swirl strawberry sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen; cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Refrigerate at least 4 hours to overnight before serving.</li>
